# Insolite Company Handbook

Welcome to the Insolite Company Handbook! This repository serves as a central resource for information on how we run our company. As a living document, it's regularly updated with new insights and experiences to reflect our ongoing growth and evolution. We encourage feedback and contributions from everyone in our community.

## Sections
Our handbook is organized into several sections, each covering an essential aspect of our company's operations:

- [Company](https://github.com/insolite-dev/handbook/blob/main/company.md): Details about our company's mission, vision, and values, as well as information about our organizational structure and policies.
- [Engineering](https://github.com/insolite-dev/handbook/blob/main/engineering.md): Information about our development process, coding standards, and technology stack.
- [Onboarding](https://github.com/insolite-dev/handbook/blob/main/onboarding.md): An overview of how we welcome new team members and help them get up to speed quickly.
